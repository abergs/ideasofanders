As of today, I am no longer working at Caspeco.
I'm writing this blog post on board of the commute train between Stockholm and Uppsala. After five years working for Caspeco, it's now time to take the next step in my journey. I will attend the *Digital Data Strategist* program at **[Hyper Island](http://hyperisland.se)** for the next 1Â½ year.  

I started working for Caspeco as a teenager. I were 19 years old and a junior developer when I made my first commit to the Caspeco SVN repository. My experience with programming were limited to HTML, CSS, some jQuery and simple PHP webpages. Since then I've had the amazing opportunity to delve into all sorts of corners in the wonderful world of code and programming.  

From building *monolithic desktop applications, simple todo-systems, advanced todo-systems, installing our Continuous-Integration Server, optimizing MySQL databases, building Single Page Applications, Web widgets,* exploring *Microsoft Azure*, hacking on *Raspberry PI's* and a thousand things more ... and finally for the last one and a half years, taking on the responsibility to move Caspeco away from its roots in the Windows Desktop market and deploying us on all devices fitted with a web browser, designing and building both the front end platform as well as the server infrastructure and the backend API's. 

*Wow*. Reading the list of things I've done at Caspeco makes proud. Proud of myself for pushing forward. Proud of Caspeco for supporting me.

If I were to name one thing that is important for me in an employer, it would be *to be given the opportunity to learn*. And boy, did I learn a lot at Caspeco. 

Thank you Caspeco - until next time,  
Anders.
