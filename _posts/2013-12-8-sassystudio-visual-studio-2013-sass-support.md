I've used Bootstrap a lot earlier but have recently used ZURB's Foundation (which reached [version 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) just some week ago).

The problem is that Visual Studio does not support SASS compilation out of the box (unlike the experience with LESS, that at least in VS2013 "just works").

There are some commercial plugins, available when you search for SASS in the extension library, but the one that I've found to work the best is [SassyStudio](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/85fa99a6-e4c6-4a1c-9f00-e6a8129b6f4d), which is also free and available on github.

Just a quick share since I found it hard to find any tips about .sass file support in visual studio on the interwebs.

Ciao!
