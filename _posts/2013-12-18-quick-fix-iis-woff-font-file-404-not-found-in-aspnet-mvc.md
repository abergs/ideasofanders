This is just a very quick "bugfix" I found.  
When using Twitter Bootstrap Glyphicons the font comes in a lot of flavors, including .ttf and woff. Somehow it seems that IIS will return a 404 not found when requesting the .woff file -- even though the file definitely exists and the URL is correct. The problem lies within the MIME-types that IIS use.

You'll have to add this MIME:

    <system.webServer>
        <staticContent>
          <remove fileExtension=".woff" />
          <mimeMap fileExtension=".woff" mimeType="application/x-font-woff" />
        </staticContent>    
      </system.webServer>

If you don't want to add this to the web.config, you can also configure the IIS server in the UI.  
VÃ³ila!
