TL;DR: [LocalizedRoutes on GitHub](https://github.com/abergs/LocalizedRoutes)

I am currently developing a project where I need to localized and theme my routes. Acutally the same website will every only run on language, but the same code will run multiple websites, so I needed to be able to cusomtize my routes. Since there were very little available online for this, I created a library and open sourced it on [Github](https://github.com/abergs/LocalizedRoutes). 

Would be cool to write a longer blog post detailing how it works, but knowing my self thah won't probably happen. 

Anyway, if you are looking for how to localize your routes in asp.net core or maybe (as me) just want to theme the urls, definitely take a look at [LocalizedRoute](https://github.com/abergs/LocalizedRoutes) for ASP.NET MVC Core 1.0, available as NuGet as well!
