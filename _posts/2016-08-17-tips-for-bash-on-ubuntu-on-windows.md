Shoutout to this repo: [abergs/ubuntuonwindows](https://github.com/abergs/ubuntuonwindows). It contains a a collaborative list of good things to know and setup when you run Bash on your Windows 10 machine (Which is natively available since the Windows Anniversary Update). 

It covers everything from setting up SSH to how to access your files on your windows drive and vice versa. It's awesome.

Have a good one! /Anders
